\section{As Old As It Can Be}

C++ is an old language (1982) initially thought as an improved C.

Official specs were:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it The C++ programming language} (1985),
\item {\it The C++ programming language} (updated) and {\it The
  Annotated C++ Reference Manual} (1991),
\item The Standard (1998 and after)
\end{itemize}

The standard from 1998 set the ground for a new era of compilers.

Theoretically, devs can switch easily from one compiler to the
other. Clients are not tied to the vendor's compiler anymore.

\section{The Standard}

The standard is defined by {\em The ISO C++ Commitee}, i.e. people from the
industry: Google, HP, Oracle, Intel and many more.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf c++98} defined the core features: the syntax, the memory
  model, templates, namespaces… And the Standard Template Library
  (STL): {\tt std::vector}, {\tt std::string}, {\tt std::map}.
\item {\bf c++03} fixes some wording and inconsistencies.
\item {\bf c++11} the beginning of {\em modern c++}. Initially
  expected during the 00's, the commitee had to kiss goodbye to some
  awaited feature. Better done than perfect.
\item {\bf c++14} mostly bug fixes but also nice features:
  e.g. variable templates.
\item {\bf c++17} nice new features: fold expressions, {\tt if
  constexpr}, copy ellision, {\tt std::optional}, {\tt
  string\_view}…
\item {\bf c++20} {\tt std::span}, concepts, modules… Also: your
  compiler still doesn't fully support C++17.
\end{itemize}

\section{The Community}

The C++ community is made of humans.

Typical complaint \#1: ``The Standard does not even
  contain {\em feature}. One has to use {\em libfeature} for it.''

Typical complaint \#2: ``The specs for {\em same feature}
  in the standard prevent efficient implementations.  One has to use
  {\em libfeature} for it.''

Typical behaviour: ``Here's a header-only library for {\em
    feature} relying heavily on templates and metaprogramming
  stuff.''

Typical complaint \#3: ``Compilation times are too long!
  The commitee should do something about that!''

Humans…
